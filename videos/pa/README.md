In this folder you should put the preview audios that **Pump Selector** will use. Since we don't have any common audio format over all browsers we should have here 2 formats that one of them are supporter over all browsers. The formats are **ogg** (Supported by Chrome and Firefox), **mp3** ( Supported by Chrome and Internet Explorer).

Maybe the browsers changed their support to audio formats, the Pump Selector auto-selects the supported video giving preference for MP3 (that is the best format we can have for that).

The videos should be named like:

    1005.mp3
    1005.ogg

1005 is the Hex of the SongID
