In this folder you should put the preview audios that **Pump Selector** will use. It will only be used as a place-holder for the video (a.k.a. when video is not ready to show, it will show the preview image). All browsers support jpg so I just search for a jpeg file.

The images should be named like:

    1005.jpg

1005 is the Hex of the SongID
