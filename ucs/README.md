This is the folder of UCS Assets. We have basicly three folders here:
    *   img     ->  Holder for Background Images
    *   mp3     ->  Holder for Mp3 Audios
    *   ogg     ->  Holder for Ogg Audios

The **img** folder holds the background images. It is a **JPEG** file with the UCS Name on it (ex: CS031.jpg).

The **mp3** and **ogg** folders follow the pattern of **img** folder but with .mp3 and .ogg extensions. The two audios are necessary because Firefox doesn't yet support mp3 due licensing. This could be changed until you read this, so UCS Visual will just select what the browsers supports giving preference for mp3.
